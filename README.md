Simply put one can't be a good developer without improving algorithmic logical thinking.
Quite frankly I find smart algorithms delightful. I love the way my brain feels when I think
through a problem. 

If you are someone that likes having their brains tickeled by the feather tip of algorithmic delight,
feel free to follow, star, like and most importantly contribute.
